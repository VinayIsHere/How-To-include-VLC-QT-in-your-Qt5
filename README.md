# How-To-include-VLC-QT-in-your-Qt5
In this repository you will find the details of how to include VLC-QT in your Qt application and use it's modules.
I am using Qt 5.14.2 (GCC 5.3.1 20160406 (Red Hat 5.3.1-6), 64 bit) in Ubuntu.

To see how to install the vlc-qt in your system just read ```how_to_install.md```
